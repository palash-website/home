**C.O.D.E - Constructive and Opinionated Dialoges for Engagement**

C.O.D.E is what I believe we need in order to understand and solve the problems that face India today. We need opinionated people to come together and engage via dialoges to produce constructive ideas that we together feel can address any given problem at India scale. This is a hard act, but the outcomes will be amazing and hence this is an act worth pursuing. 

After spending more than two decades in software industry ([my professional profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrityunjaykumar/)), and a few years in doing PhD ([my research profile](https://algodynamics.systems/)), I strongly believe that a systems thinking and data-driven decision-making can help us get alignment in problems and quality in solutions.

I am passionate about many topics: Education & Career, Technology & Society, and Policy & Governance. Feel free to look around and get in touch.
