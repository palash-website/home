As Indians, traditionally we have taken very algorithmic approach to careers: our marks determine the college we are supposed to pick, family and friends determine the current hot areas of careers that should be pursued and externally controlled parameters (like performance reviews, what does my manager think, etc.) tend to shape our view of our career growth. There is a need to change this approach and be more proactive in managing your career. Very few managers these days have expertise and time to manage your career for you; and even when they do, they are not in the best position to do so since they don’t know you as much as you know yourself. So it is important that you manage your own career. There are a lot of skills required to manage your career proactively. following posts from our sister site touch on various aspects of career management activities that should be performed:
