Recently I bumped onto this post from Sanjoy about a [career management cum social networking company idea](http://www.venturewoods.org/index.php/2007/03/21/career-management/). It is a "career management application that combines social networking, resume management and ongoing skill development". It is interesting because it looks at this industry from the consumer's perspective, the individual who is looking for a job. Similar thoughts has led to creation of [JibberJobber](http://www.jibberjobber.com/login.php). Here is how one blog describes it:  "[JibberJobber is a set of tools that anyone with an interest in managing their own career should embrace.](http://sixdegreesfromdave.com/?p=68)"

Of course, there are the business networking tools like [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) which are evolving to be more helpful to job seekers even though they cater to general business networking area (how good your network can be if it can't get you a good job?).

However, there aren't really good tools out there which can help a job-seeker: what they need is on the lines of resume/job management system! Anyone interested in building one, or knows something existing?
