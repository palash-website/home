A pleasing voice, a soothing tune,

A fleeting face, a shadow to chase, 

How long will it last,

This dream, this craze, 

The wasted youth, the wayward ways. 


Smoldering heart, bleeding pores, 

A searing pain, a gasp so blue,

As death takes hold, 

As life drips away,

The waiting eyes, the hopeful gaze.
