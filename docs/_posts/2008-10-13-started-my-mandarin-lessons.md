Finally I started my mandarin lessons, 3 days a week, 100 minutes each. First 2 classes were about sounds (called Finals in the book), and how to make simple words using the initials (consonants). I was amazed to know there are 39 finals (English has only 5 vowels and 2 semi-vowels in comparison, hindi has about 12 '_swara'_)! This is one more reason learning this will be tough. My teacher is good but her English is not good enough to understand what I am trying to communicate many times, but we are learning!

I also visited couple of huge bookstores, which obviously carry all the books in mandarin. I am much more enthused now about the language, hopefully I can learn to read it so that I can have the joy of walking in those big shops and picking some books to read (even the largest Barnes and Noble I found in US was comparable to these shops).

Here are some tools I found on the web which are useful:

[Yahoo Babelfish](http://babelfish.yahoo.com/translate_txt) – useful when someone writes something to you in Chinese but you can't understand; or when you want to wow someone by writing in Chinese. Supports many language translations.

[English-Chinese Dictionary](http://www.mandarintools.com/worddict.html) – I like the English and pinyin search because it gives pronunciation of the word which is extremely helpful. Note how many different meanings exist for each word.

[Pinyin on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin) – As usual, this is a great reference for those who want to know all about something in one go, with rules and all.
