As I was completing the performance reviews for my team, I was reminded of the fact that so few people actually do a good job of appraising themselves. I have noticed this over the past 5-6 years that I am doing performance reviews and have gotten similar feedback from several other folks, and it hasn't changed much even though now many organizations are moving to performance management software from paper/MS-Word based systems.

It is also surprising to see that most of the mistakes are common:

- Rating themselves too high
    
- Not providing enough concrete examples of why they feel they deserve such a high rating.
    
- Not identifying areas of improvement or lessons learnt (which is the most important goal of self-assessment)
    
- Not distinguishing between competency assessment and task assessment
    

Do you agree, or you have seen otherwise? If you do, why do you think this is the case? I am sure there are enough literature out there which talk about how to measure performance, of self or others, or do you think that is not the case?
