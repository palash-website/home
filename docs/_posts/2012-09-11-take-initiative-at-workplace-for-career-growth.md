Taking initiative is about picking up organizational challenges to solve without being asked and delivering results. Taking initiative is one of the best ways to achieve stardom at workplace. If you are interested in growing your career in the current company, you must take initiatives. Even when you don't feel passionate about the organization or your manager to take initiative, do it for the selfish reason of your career growth and development. However, when you take some initiative at your workplace, ensure these things:

1. Identify right problems to solve
2. Have clear goals and measures of success
3. Make sure you can produce results (from ability and organization perspective)
4. Build and maintain credibility (so that others can help you succeed).
