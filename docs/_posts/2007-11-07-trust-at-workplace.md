I came across an interesting post on this on Cheri Baker's blog: [Trust in the workplace](http://blog.emergenceconsulting.net/2007/11/trust-in-the-wo.html "Manager vs. Manager"). It is a good read if you are interested in discussing how trust plays a role in workplace when you go talk to HR  about some issues and HR has to take it up with your manager. My experience has beeen slightly different, and I feel we should do much more to preserve employee-HR trust relationship, even at the cost of manager-HR relationship. Otherwise system of checks and balances breaks down and if there are some organizational issues where manager is the culprit or untrusted by employees, HR doesn't get involved early enough to help out. Given the fact that manager-employee relationship hinges on lots of daily/weekly interactions and can breakdown in a heartbeat, it is important to make sure HR-employee safety valve exists at all times.

What do you think?
