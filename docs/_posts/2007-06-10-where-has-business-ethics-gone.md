I was travelling to India for a week (by flying on the weekends and working on the week), and among other reasons to travel was a very important reason: we were  hiring my peer in India organization and I wanted to make sure I am there when he joins so that we can sync up correctly, I hand over the responsibilities etc, and we start talking about future. Everyone else in the company (HR director, recruiter, VP E) had been keeping him engaged, counting down to his joining date, which was to be the last day of my trip.

The day before he was to travel to our office, he became inaccessible via phone, and things went downhill after that, and finally, on the day of joining, he let us know that he couldn't join because of some personal reason! 

I was utterly frustrated, more so by the fact that even people for senior positions do not have the guts in them to tell the truth, as early as they can. Or is it the case of missing business ethics?

I would be interested in hearing others' stories and their experiences in these situations.. do leave your comments or drop me a note.
