For a very long time, I have hosted my sites using wordpress.com. They were cost-effective, and didn't suck me into maintenance and tweaking tasks (that wordpress.org did). 

However, more recently, the price has been going up, packages seem to be designed for those who are running business of some kind using these sites. Clearly, someone having a simple blog site who doesn't want ads and wants a few nice themes and plug-ins to spruce it up doesn't fit. Hence, while my bill kept going up (I have 2-3 sites that I use regularly), they mostly went in getting rid of the problems they created in the first place (pesky ads, limits on themes and plugins). 
So I felt it was time to look for cheaper alternatives an github presented itself as a worthy one, given my limited needs. 

So here I am, with a much simplified web site, that only focuses on the content. I am also taking this opportunity to merge my three personas: the researcher, the career coach, and the opinionated Indian! This is always a tricky proposition, given the audiences are different for each of my persona, but we will see how that goes!
