When she went away, I thought it was a dream, 
I waited to wake up, 
To fight and make up, 
Oh! How naive I was! 
Sad but hopeful, 
Life will restart, 
But that was not to be.. It was the 
Warmth of a broken heart. 

Rustle in the wind? Was it her soothing sigh?
Eyes flickered, I woke up, with a rude shock, 
Simmering heat of the amber of hope, 
Dripping soul, was ripped apart,
It was too much to bear.. 
The warmth of a broken heart.
