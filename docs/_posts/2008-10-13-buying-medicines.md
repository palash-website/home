Buying medicines was tougher than I thought. We asked in various govt hospitals but couldn't figure out what they were saying! Later we were told that they give medicine only on the prescriptions from their own doctors. When I went to couple of pharmacy, they wouldn't understand English prescriptions. I tried looking up Chinese names for those medicines, but no luck. Finally some searches on expat forums got us to [Parkway community pharmacy](http://www.parkwaycommunitypharmacy.com) in Pudong (no relation to ParkwayHealth group of hospitals) who could talk in English on phone, could understand the english names, could deliver at home, and to top it all, the price of the medicines were almost 50% of what ParkwayHealth hospital was trying to charge me! Amazing, but true. I am definitely going there next time I have to buy medicines.
