### Introduction

Performance review time is one of the most stressful period in an organization, both for the employees and for their managers. Given the fact that most managers don't provide performance feedback during the year and wait for the performance review season to do so, it becomes the time for surprises, brickbats, and distress. The crucial 1-1 conversation between employee and their manager becomes the most important conversation of the year which determines many aspects of the career. So it is important for everyone (employee and manager) to be ready.
