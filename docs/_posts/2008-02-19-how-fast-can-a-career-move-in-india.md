Interesting read, [this article on rediff](http://inhome.rediff.com/money/2008/feb/19bspec.htm "http://inhome.rediff.com/money/2008/feb/19bspec.htm"). Good examples of how busineess is reacting to the changing changing face of careerist youth in India. The article does note an important point:

> Still, there are plenty of tensions between companies and young employees. Many Indian engineers are fascinated with cutting-edge technologies, yet much of the work for clients calls for tried-and-true techniques.

> And while young people are eager to get promotions and overseas assignments, there are practical limits to how quickly they can advance. "They have to learn to adjust," says T.V. Mohandas Pai, director of human resources at Infosys. "It's almost like growing up."

Given the fact that most of the IT industry in India is IT [services](http://cuberules.com/2008/02/14/career-management-in-india-part-two/ "http://cuberules.com/2008/02/14/career-management-in-india-part-two/"), there isn't enough for a really hungry professional. Also, growth means promotion for most Indian IT professionals, which can't (and shouldn't) happen too fast. Many companies succumb to this pressure from their employee base however and start promoting very young engineers into management roles, often with disasterous consequences for the individual. Product companies provide refreshingly new approach to career planning and management, but they are very few and not really sold well in job market (where brand name still sells).
