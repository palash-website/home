When darkness fades, and light enters you, 
You are dreaming well, you are dreaming true, 
But dreams are dull, colors have faded away, 
You are a black-and-white girl, or so they say. 

Can they be right? 
Are you just black-and-white?
Or they haven’t seen your colors, 

Purple with rage, when I leave you alone,
Pink with joy, with an icecream cone,
Blue all over, when the sky turns gray, 
You are black-and-white girl, that’s why they say. 

They can’t be right, 
They need my eyes,
To see your colors,
Beyond the black and white.
