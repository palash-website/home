_Dear Alumni,_

_We are glad to announce the elections of new members of the Executive Committee of IIT Delhi Alumni Association for the year 2013. It has been noticed that there is a very thin attendance in the AGM chaired by the Director IITD and Chairman IITDAA owing to the election process and cultural programme, which is not only embarrassing but also not in the interest of the Association. To improve attendance at the AGM, the program will start at 5:00 P.M. Voting will be from 5:00-6:30 p.m. Only_

After coming back to India in Feb 2012 to start my second innings of life, getting associated with IITD Alumni Association (IITDAA) has been on top of my mind. And being part of the executive committee is one of the best ways of getting connected and make some impact. So I have gone ahead and begged 2 of my friends to fill the nomination form for me and send in. And I have been told that it has actually reached the Alumni office in IITD campus, no mean achievement considering process fiascos in shipping and delivery!

I don't have pleasant memories of my prior experience of such an attempt. Last time (in 2000-2001), a few of my friends and I decided to become part of IITDAA Noida Chapter. We attended a few sessions, hoping to get excited and involved. While the samosas served were great (and worth attending the meeting for), it was a pain to listen to the bickering about by-laws and laws of the Noida Chapter. It didn't help that we were kids in the eyes of those who mattered in the chapter, average age there was 50 years I think.

So why am I throwing my hat in the ring this time? I guess I am an eternal hopeful guy: I think I can at least understand the importance of by-laws since I have been subjected to many by-laws through my association with multiple RWAs (Resident Welfare Associations) and have been subjected to many 100-page renter's agreements in US. And of course, I am married now, so I have now been trained by in-laws.. err.. trained in by-laws ;-)

On a serious note, in this inning of my career, I am focusing on doing things where my passion lies. My company [Career Bloom](http://careerbloom.in) works in the area of career management, career coaching, talent management, and education. I strongly believe that IITs and IIT alumni have a lot to offer to the society as well as learn from it if they can engage with society on 2 topics (which are related): education and career. While the IITDAA does engage on these 2 topics, I think we need to take it up a few notches, and I would like to help do it.

**As an EC member, in addition to helping other initiatives, I want to conceptualize and drive 2 initiatives:**

1. **Career\-** Connect IITD students and alumni to the large community of college students and working professionals – IITD students and alumni will offer career guidance and mentoring. IITD students will also learn to understand and solve real-life issues that come in the way of career development, and become prepared for a rich career. This will be enabled through technology platform as well as 'each 1, reach 5' model, where individuals impact others who live in their home town, current place of residence, etc.
2. **Higher Education** - Create a volunteering network of IITD Alumni and students which help curate the large amount of free educational content available online and make it easier for students and learners in colleges. Free content (MIT, MOOCs, etc.) are great resource, but when you think of a tier-3 city college student trying to use it who has poor English, lack of understanding of foreign context (baseball doesn't mean anything to him maybe), you realize this content needs to be contextualized or wrapped in more content in order to be effective for him. Smart and passionate IIT students and alumni can help a great deal. This is mutually beneficial, because best way of learning is being able to teach (or create teaching material that works).

If you feel for these areas, and think IITDAA can/should make an impact, please leave a note for me here, I would love to get in touch and listen to your ideas and thoughts on the subject. And if you are coming to the AGM on 27th, it will be nice to get your support too! J
