In India, best known career paths are those of managers. An Individual Contributor track hasn't really been developed by companies. This means that there is a natural push towards management if someone wants to grow. However, this is slowly changing. With the growth of product and internet companies in India, as well as constant desire of services company to move up the value chain, there is a renewed demand for high-quality individual contributors (IC), and they fetch a high premium in the salary. However, it is important to select the right company to be an IC, otherwise career will suffer. Most companies are bad at managing their star ICs and at offering them good career growth path. What is most important is to stay proactive about your career.
