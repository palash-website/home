In my previous posts on [managing one's own career](http://careermanagement.wordpress.com/2008/01/27/manage-your-career-please/ "http://careermanagement.wordpress.com/2008/01/27/manage-your-career-please/"), I mentioned that a great way to measure your progress in career is tracking it against your desired career growth path. This is a great way because it provides us with the most direct way of mesuring the return on the time and talent investment we are doing in current job. However, this raises the question: how do I create the map of my career path so that I can track my progress against it. Easier said than done, right?

Here are the ingredients I have used to map my own career and of people who have asked me for career advice:

1. **Your value system**: These are the set of values you live your life with (or want to live with). They define who you are, and what are acceptable and unacceptable paths of life for you. 
2. **Your life goal:** Every career map needs a rallying point: the major objective of life, the reason you want to live and feel motivated to work at all. Defining this takes effort, but this needs to be a clearly defined (and mentally visible) goal 'significantly' down the road.
    
    **Your strengths and weaknesses:** These are the foundations on which you will build your career, so it is essential you know them well. A good career map uses the strengths and avoids the weaknesses.
    
3. **Your likes and dislikes**: A great career path is sustainable only when you do what you like to do, at least most of the time. So it is useful to know them in advance.
    
4. **Your current and desired skills:** What skills you possess and are working towards are necessary to determine a starting point of the career as well as direction of career change at any given point of time.
    

If you know all of these aspects of your life, mapping a career path can be broken like this:

1. Break the goal into 1-2 yr milestones, each milestone should be defined in a [SMART](http://www.topachievement.com/smart.html "http://www.topachievement.com/smart.html") way. This is the hardest part because this needs to take care of your value system as well as your strengths profile. A project management approach will help here, so will involving a career counselor or a mentor.
    
2. For the immediate milestone, figure out what you need to be doing now in order to reach there. This may mean changing your role or company or both, so this is a careful decision. Also, this needs to make sure your likes and dislikes are taken care of, because this will involve learning new skills and it better be in an  area you like.
    
3. Write down your plan for next 12 months and make sure you discuss with your manager so that he/she understands your aspirations. If he/she is not bought in, it may be much more difficult to achieve.
    

Make sure you review this entire plan as well as the ingredients above every quarter or so (depends on the pace at which your company/project/life is moving). Be open for changing any of these. Typically the value system will not change at all, goal will change very slowly, and others can change rapidly.

What has been your recipe for career planning? Do you think career can be planned? I will be interested in knowing your thoughts about this.
