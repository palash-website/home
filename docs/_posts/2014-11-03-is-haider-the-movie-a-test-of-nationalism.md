**Me**: "Did you watch Haider? It is a good movie."

**A family member**: "No, I didn't. I heard it is an anti-national movie."

I was shocked by the response! This wasn't one of those hate-mongering, ultra-nationalists people in abundance in India these days; this was a sober, soft-spoken, family member who genuinely believed what he said.

When the movie [Haider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haider_(film)) released, I wanted to watch it because I wanted to see how well Vishal Bhardwaj did the Hamlet adaptation. When I read about it being 'sympathetic' to Muslims and critical of Army, I dismissed it as a fiction created by media for some masala, and still wanted to watch it. When I did watch it, I could understand what those articles meant â€“ it was a narrative different than the usual ones we have heard in mainstream media and writing. I chalked it down again to the over-zealousness of media and Facebook-citizens wanting to create masala. I was glad that I watched the movie, and promptly forgot those Facebook posts and articles.

When I remember the movie (my daughters play the songs of the movie everyday), I don't remember the narrative that much (fortunately or unfortunately); what I remember is the well-crafted storyline with layered storytelling, super acting, breathtaking cinematography, brilliant music, lyrics and singing, and of course the cleverness with which hamlet storyline has been incorporated.

As Voltaire [said](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/v/voltaire109645.html), "I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it." The speaker in this [TED video](http://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story) puts it very eloquently, there are dangers in knowing a single story about a region/culture/people. As a nation, if we can't let multiple stories play out, if we can't get out of political correctness and let moral correctness play out, we are not going to be a nation worth its name. And we can't claim to be a nationalist if we behave like [ultra-nationalists or ultra-populists](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-road-to-ultrapopulism/article6558114.ece).

I am passionate about my country. I take this as my definition of nationalism and this makes me a strong nationalist. And my nationalism is strong and broad enough to understand an alternate narrative; it can tolerate a point of view that is different than mine (even when I don't agree with it). It can sympathize with those who suffer, without checking their religion or region.

What about you?
