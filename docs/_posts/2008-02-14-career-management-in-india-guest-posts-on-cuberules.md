[Cube Rules](http://cuberules.com/about-cube-rules/ "http://cuberules.com/about-cube-rules/") is a blog where Scott Herrick discusses the perspective of the 'cubicle warriors', his blog is aptly named '[Career Management for Cubicle Warriors](http://cuberules.com/ "http://cuberules.com/")'. Recently, I got a chance to do couple of guest posts there around career management in India (Thanks Scott!). In an attempt to do justice to the topics I chose, I decided to dig deeper into Indian career management situation, why it is the way it is, and it was an interesting journey.

You can read those posts here:
