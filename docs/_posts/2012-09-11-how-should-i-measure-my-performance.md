Typically, employees rely on their manager's feedback, performance review feedback and salary hikes to decipher whether they are growing enough. However, most of these attributes are not controlled by the employee and these attributes can change without any change in the employee's performance (for example, if budget is cut, salary hike could be 0, this doesn't mean lack of performance). Therefore, we recommend two other measures to be added to the mix of self-performance measures: **learning** and **job complexity**. If learning goals are met/exceeded, there is a good chance that career is growing too. Similarly, working in a highly complex/challenging job environment is a good sign of career growth.
