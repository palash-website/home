As you would have noticed, I haven't been posting on this site for couple of months now. Things have been hectic on personal and professional front. Big news is that I will be relocating to Shanghai, China; a new company, a new country awaits me, and I am excited about the opportunity to learn and experience so much. I am in US till end of the month (July), will be on vacation in India (Aug) and then join in China (Sep). I will be start posting in couple of days, there are lots of topics I have been holding off on! Thanks for being patient.
