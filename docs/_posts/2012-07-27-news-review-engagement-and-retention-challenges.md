It has been a while since I posted here. I have been extremely busy with lots of interesting things happening with me, and I am enjoying my unemployment thoroughly. I have met lots of interesting people over last few months, including a large number of working professionals who are trying to make changes to their career to zoom ahead. I will post some of my insights from them in a later post, but today I wanted to comment on various news articles I read in Indian business newspapers within few days of each other (Jul 11-13, 2012).

Engagement and retention are issues that organizations are increasingly grappling with. Half of the employees leaving within 5 years may not sound very scary, but organizations which rely on their stars to save the day and carry the mediocres along can't afford to lose 50% of those stars even in a period as long as 5 years. The churn of workforce in India is at all levels (35% have less than 2 years tenure and a 3rd executives planning to change office within 2 years) and one-third think they are not allowed to perform to their potential because of organizational issues. Overall, this doesn't paint a good picture about Indian Industries and their future. As I have maintained all along, one of the key drivers for engagement is the perception about organization's willingness and efforts to address career development needs for the employees. Indian companies tend to pay only lip service to this (canned training, manager's trainings) rather than offer customized and targeted career solutions, at least to their star employees.

Here are the news articles I talked about.

[Depressed Employee Engagement Stunts Global Business Performance](http://www.haygroup.com/in/press/details.aspx?id=34133) – original hay group press release that triggered many of the news below.

- _Employee engagement levels in India stand marginally higher than the Asia average, at 68 per cent_
- _58 per cent of employees in India set to exit their present organizations before 2017_

- _Company loyalty hits five-year low_
