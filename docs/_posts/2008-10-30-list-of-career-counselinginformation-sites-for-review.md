As I mentioned in my [previous post](http://careermanagement.wordpress.com/2008/10/30/completed-a-month-working-in-shanghai/), I plan to review some of the web sites/companies that offer services in the general area of career counseling/guidance/management. Here is the list that I have come up with. Here is how I picked these sites:

1. Listed some of the web sites that I heard about via TV channels or friends
2. Did Google search and Live Search on "career management india", "career counseling India", and "career guidance india", and looked at sites listed in top 2-3 pages. I picked the sites which looked useful as well as those which seemed to be used by people (testimonies, client names, etc).

 I have categorized them in 3 buckets:

1. **Counseling/guidance services** – These are the sites which offer career counseling and guidance. They typically include training, psychometric tests, some articles, etc.
2. **Career Information Aggregators** – These are the sites which have a large list of courses and universities and other study opportunities. They typically have a subsection about career counseling etc, but their main focus is information aggregation.
3. **Job site adjuncts** – These are the career center sub-sites of major job sites.

 Sites are listed in alphabetical order within each category. Some sites span categories but I have tried to categorize them based on major use of the site. If you would like to recommend a site, please [send me a note](mailto://futuresense.wp@gmail.com) or post your comment.
