In the blog '[Social Leadership](http://blog.foghound.com/504/)', Lois Kelly has more sobering view of the role of social media in any career management, unlike my [yesterday's post](http://careerpathindia.wordpress.com/2009/05/04/leveraging-social-network-in-career-management/). Here is how she starts:

> Some days I get so sick about talking and reading about social media. Here’s why: most of the fundamentals of  marketing and leadership are the same as they always have been.  The social tools are merely enablers.  You can be a social media wizard at using Twitter, YouTube, blogs, communities and the like and still be a marketing or management dud.

 She goes on to talk about how communication competencies are important, and other aspects of leadership development. A good read for everyone who wish to be leaders in their organizations.
